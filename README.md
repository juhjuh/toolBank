I'm putting my time into learning as much as I can about Javascript and web-dev in general.  Here, I will be putting different (smaller) tools to have a central location for them.  


My biggest goal here is to create a log of what I'm learning and how I would explain how to do it to you.
   While broadening my conceptual understand, I hope I can help another noob do the same.
