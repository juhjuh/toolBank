I'm putting my time into learning as much as I can about Javascript and web-dev in general.  Here, I will be putting different (smaller) tools to have a central location for them.  


My biggest goal here is to create a log of what I'm learning and how I would explain how to do it to you.
   While broadening my conceptual understand, I hope I can help another noob do the same.



   Things I would like to add:
      - background color generator
            + based on whatever options there are in CSS, you can see them real time
      - calculator
            + a good beginner project, but I want to experiment with elegance and fun features
      - email-to-text phone updates..
            + this can go from basic to more involved..
            + I would like to have a user login with their personal (verified/invited) account and
              be able to view what reminders they have scheduled... ex; take out the trash

* unordered list, this is?  


* it would be cool to have a CSS playground for myself..
*  - what if I could add a few HTML blocks and then style them live to see what they might look like on a page?
